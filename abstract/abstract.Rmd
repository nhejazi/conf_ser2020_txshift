Causal inference has classically focused on the effect of static interventions,
under which the magnitude of the treatment is set to a fixed, prespecified value
for each unit. The evaluation of such interventions faces a host of issues,
among them non-identification, violations of the assumption of positivity, and
inefficiency. Stochastic interventions provide a promising solution to these
fundamental issues by allowing for the

referred to the parameter being estimated as a counterfactual risk, under a
(hypothetically) shifted exposure distribution

counterfactual intervention distribution
to be defined as a function of its natural (observed) distribution. Despite the
promise of such approaches, real data analyses are often further complicated by
economic constraints, such as when the primary variable of interest is far more
expensive to collect than auxiliary covariates.  Two-phase sampling schemes are
often used to work around such constraints -- unfortunately, their use produces
side effects that require further adjustment when formal inference is the
principal goal of a study. We present a novel approach for use in such settings:
augmented targeted minimum loss and one-step estimators for the causal effects
of stochastic interventions, with guarantees of consistency, efficiency, and
multiple robustness even in the presence of two-phase sampling. We further
propose a technique that utilizes estimated counterfactual means under
stochastic interventions to construct a nonparametric working marginal
structural model to summarize the effects of changes in an exposure variable on
the outcome of interest, analogous to a dose-response analysis. Using data from
the recent HVTN 505 HIV vaccine efficacy trial, we demonstrate this technique by
assessing the effects of changes in post-vaccination immunogenicity on HIV-1
acquisition across a range of possible shifts, outlining a highly interpretable
variable importance measure for ranking multiple immune responses based on their
utility as immunogenicity study endpoints in future HIV-1 vaccine trials.
