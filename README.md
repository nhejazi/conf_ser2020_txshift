* __Title__: Robust inference on the causal effects of stochastic interventions
  under two-phase sampling, with applications in vaccine efficacy trials

### Abstract

Stochastic interventions provide a promising solution to fundamental issues
posed by non- identification and inefficiency in causal inference, by allowing
for the counterfactual intervention distribution to be defined as a function of
its natural distribution. While such approaches are promising, real data
analyses are often further complicated by economic constraints, such as when the
primary variable of interest is far more expensive to collect than auxiliary
covariates. Two-phase sampling schemes offer a promising solution --
unfortunately, their use produces side effects that require further adjustment
when inference remains the principal goal. We present a novel approach for use
in such settings: An augmented targeted minimum loss-based estimator for the
causal effects of stochastic interventions, with guarantees of consistency,
efficiency, and multiple robustness even in the presence of two-phase sampling.
Using data from a recent HIV vaccine efficacy trial, we construct a technique
that provides a highly interpretable variable importance measure for ranking
multiple immune responses based on their utility as immunogenicity study
endpoints in future HIV-1 vaccine trials.
